## 1.8 Problem

#### What are the main concepts that define your brand mythology? (These are all defaults, but please change however you'd like)
```
1. Recognizably earth-like: we want people to create meaningful connections with the world our platform ecosystem creates
2. Fantasy based: we want our platform ecosystem to push the limits of what's possible so we can have a greater impact in the real world
3. Include mythology: mythology has been one of the strongest factors that have driven human civilization, so we want the same for our platform ecosystem
4. Science based: we want to build a world that can teach people concepts that people can apply in their day-to-day lives
5. Multiple intelligent species: there are 4 key players in a platform ecosystem, and we will personify them differently so they can create interesting stories
