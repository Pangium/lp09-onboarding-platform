# 0.9 OnboardingPi: Turn Your Creative Idea Into a Platform Ecosystem for Growth and Collaboration

## Transform any project idea into a platform ecosystem and develop an Onboarding Program to attract your first open source contributors and investors

## Introduction

Welcome to the "0.9 OnboardingPi" Repository by **ourStory: Everything Is Music**. Creating an onboarding program for any company is a challenge, and it's argualble even harder for decentralized and open source platforms. This GitHub Repository is a template for anyone who wants to streamline their project's Onboarding Program with oS3 (ourStory openSource operatingSystem). By completing this process, you'll reimagine your existing idea as a platform ecosystem and develop a unique and comprehensive Onboarding Program that empowers contributors, nonprofits, small businesses, and investors to support your growth. Specifically, you will create the following for your platform ecosystem:

* b90onboarding: Metadata that acts as the DNA for the platform ecosystem that you're creating (GitHub Repository; FigJam)
* b90training: A draft manifesto that introduces your platform ecosystem's public documentation (GitHub Wiki; FigJam)
* b18governance: A collaborative communication forum to submit each deliverable with your onboarding agent (GitHub Discussions; FigJam)
* b81operations: A shared workspace to conduct meetings and workshops (GitHub Projects; FigJam)
* b27product: A website to present your minimum viable product (GitHub Pages; Figma)
* b72design: A Pitch Deck to attract contributors, nonprofits, small businesses, and investors (Figma)
* b36story: A proof-of-work protocol storyboard and music playlist to start your brand mythology (Instagram, Affinity Designer)
* b63marketing: A book quote inspired Go-To-Market Strategy for your your platform ecosystem (GitHub Projects; Hypefury)
* b45publication: A draft "About" section for your platform ecosystem's publication podcast (Substack, YouTube)
* b54portfolio: A proof-of-work proposal and payment gateway for investors (GitHub Sponsors)

This process is the first step towards creating your 9 dimensional Internal Developer Platform (IDP) inspired by Backstage. Join us in fostering innovation and collaboration as we bridge the gap between digital and physical innovation through Platform and Civil Engineering.

## Contribution Guidelines
Thanks for you interest in contributing to this project. We want to make these instructions simple enough so a 7 year old can easily create an onboarding program for any project they want to create with their family and friends. Once you create your own onboarding program for yourself, you will receive instructions on how you can contribute to this and other oS3 projects with ourStory.

## Contribution Expectations
Find a typo, bug, or think of a much easier way to create an onboarding program? Rather than worrying about pull requests, clone this repository, implement the changes you think this template should incorporate, and we'll review it once your Onboarding Agent confirms your proof-of-work. We can't wait to see how you can help us make this process even better!

## Known Issues
This repository/tutorial is a work in progress. Here are the top three items that we're focused on. If you have others that you think we should incorporate, please send us an email (jacques@trainfarb.com)
- Each of these files are rough drafts. Each step will have illustrations and diagrams to make this process easier to follow. (We're in the early adoptor phase, so please don't expect perfection)
- There are a lot of repeated variables throughout the various files. We need to add global variables that can be used throughout this process to make it easier on both the player and onboarding agent. Currently, we're thinking of streamlining this process with Jekyll and GitHub Pages so this can have a much better design with dynamic variables.
- Populate steps for each beat/deliverable .md file
- Add introductory video or diagram to the "How it works" section of this README
- Create a streamlined process so the public can review, add, and complete Issues
