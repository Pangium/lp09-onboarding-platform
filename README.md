oS3 is an open source storytelling library for creating self-sufficient operating systems. Once upon a time, [YOU] decided it wanted to use oS3 to gain [NEED].

To spark innovative ideas, [YOU] used metaphors an analogies to create a story that represented it as a [Eukaryotic cell]. Its initial journey was centered around finding the community’s [Cell Membrane].

In its search, [YOU] found that it would need support from a broad network to reach its goal, so it turned to [INSPIRATION] for inspiration on how to form strong bonds. To help determine how it will operate, it is learning from [MATH] and [MUSIC].

Ultimately, [YOU] realized it had a long road ahead to discover its [Cell Membrane] on its search for [NEED], but learned that its actual focus needs to be completing the challenges laid out by oS3’s [RETURN] so it can turn itself into a [CHANGED] business ecosystem.
