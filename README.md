# 0.9 OnboardingPi: Empowering Platform Ecosystem Growth and Collaboration

## Your Complete Guide to Crafting a Dynamic Onboarding Program that Catalyzes the Growth of Your Open Source Platform Ecosystem

## Introduction

Welcome to the "0.9 OnboardingPi" Repository by **ourStory: Everything Is Music**. Creating an onboarding program for any company is a challenge, and it's argualble even harder for decentralized and open source platforms. This repo is a template for anyone who wants to streamline their project's Onboarding Program with oS3 (ourStory openSource operatingSystem). By completing this process, you will develop a unique and comprehensive Onboarding Program that empowers contributors, nonprofit organizations, small businesses, and investors alike. Specifically, you will create the following for your platform ecosystem:

* Metadata: Complete a set of questions to populate the metadata that defines your ecosystem [Platform Design Engineering]
* Pitch Deck: Publish a presentation that promotes the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your ecosystem based on your platform's golden path [Machine Learning]
* Onboarding Program: Draft the proof-of-work blockchain protocol that clearly outlines the deliverables people will complete to join your project [Blockchain Technology]
* Manifesto: Complete a manifesto to tell an engaging story that paints the picture of your ecosystem's vision [Biomimicry Innovation]

This process is the first step towards creating your 9 dimensional Internal Developer Platform (IDP) inspired by Backstage. Join us in fostering innovation and collaboration as we bridge the gap between digital and physical innovation through Platform and Civil Engineering.

oS3 is an open source storytelling library for creating self-sufficient operating systems, and once upon a time, [YOU] decided it wanted to use oS3 to gain [NEED].

To spark innovative ideas, [YOU] uses analogies to create stories that represent it as a [Eukaryotic cell]. Its initial journey is centered around discovering its [Cell Membrane].

In its search, [YOU] found that it would need support from an ecosystem to reach its goal, so it turned to [INSPIRATION] for inspiration on how to form strong bonds with partners. To make sense of how these partnerships will operate, it is learning from [MATH] and [MUSIC].

Ultimately, [YOU] realized it had a long road ahead to discover its [Cell Membrane] on its search for [NEED], and now understands that its actual focus needs to be completing the challenges laid out by oS3â€™s [RETURN] so it can turn itself into a [CHANGED] business ecosystem.
